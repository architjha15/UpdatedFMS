# UpdatedFMS

I have updated my server code by modularizing it for better structure and maintainability. The core logic has been distributed across separate files â€” routes handle the endpoints, controllers manage the request-response flow, and services contain the business logic. I have also added a dedicated config file to manage the database connection, ensuring a cleaner and more organized setup. This improves scalability and makes the application easier to debug and expand.
